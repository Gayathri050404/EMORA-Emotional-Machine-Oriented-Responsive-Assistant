# 🤖 EMORA – Emotional Machine Oriented Responsive Assistant

EMORA is an AI-powered voice assistant developed using Python that enables real-time voice-based interaction with users. It uses speech recognition to understand user input, analyzes emotions, and generates intelligent responses using cloud-based AI models.

The system supports wake-word activation, continuous conversation mode, and voice-based replies, making it a smart and interactive personal assistant. EMORA integrates multiple technologies such as Natural Language Processing, Text-to-Speech, and AI APIs to provide human-like communication.

This project demonstrates practical implementation of AI, automation, and system integration for real-world applications.
